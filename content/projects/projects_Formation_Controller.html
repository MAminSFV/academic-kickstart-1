<p align="justify">
This project was carried out during the “Nonlinear Systems and Control” course. This project is a developed model of the research carried by .... The new developments introduced to this scheme were applying graph theory and using a diffrent set of fuzzy ....These improvemnts allowed the system to hold predifened geometric formations and a faster convergence respectively.
Some of the features of this project:
<ul>
  <li>A distributed multi-agent controller for a team of mobile robots </li>
  <li>Simulated using Matlab and Simulink</li>
  <li>The report is availabe here....</li>
  <li>Artificial potential feilds were used for obstance avoidance</li>
  <li>Coding and simulation using Wolfram Mathematica</li>
</ul>
