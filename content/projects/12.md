This is an ongoing project being carried out during a hands-on course on designing an electronic circuit and programming an ARM microcontroller to control a temperature chamber. The temperature of the chamber is being measured using various sensors, such as PTC, NTC, and PT100, and controlled through relays turning the heater on and off. LCD and keypad are also implemented to change the settings of the controller. Currently, the first section of the course on electronic circuit design using Altium Designer has been completed, and we are working on programming the STM32F103RBT6 microcontroller.
