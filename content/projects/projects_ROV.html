<p align="justify">
A group project for desiging an underwater vehicle for industrial needs. This bio-inspired design combines the capabilities of a conventional ROV with perks of AUVs.
Some notable features of this design project:
<ul>
  <li>Detailed CAD design</li>
  <li>Modular and robust design</li>
  <li>Multi-purpose design with high-end sensors</li>
  <li>Simulated and hydrostatic and hydrodynamic analysis using ANSYS</li>
  <li>Diffrent Control Modes for  various underwater opperations with increased stability and maneuverability</li>
</ul>
